🔐 Cyber Angel’s Portfolio – Hands-On Cybersecurity Projects

This repository showcases a collection of hands-on cybersecurity, identity & access management (IAM), and privileged access management (PAM) projects that reflect my real-world skills, growth mindset, and commitment to securing enterprise environments.

Each project is built to simulate practical security workflows, such as automated password rotation, SIEM alerting, and endpoint privilege control — inspired by the tools and principles I’ve used in professional environments (including Delinea Secret Server, Privilege Manager, Okta, and Microsoft Sentinel).
