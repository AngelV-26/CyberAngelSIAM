# 📚 Featured Projects

## 1. # Azure SIEM Monitoring Lab**

## Project Overview
This project demonstrates how I deployed and configured Microsoft Sentinel (Azure SIEM) to monitor a Windows Virtual Machine (VM) for real-time security events hosted on Azure.

## Technologies Used
- Microsoft Sentinel (Azure SIEM)
- Azure Virtual Machine (Ubuntu/Windows)
- Azure Log Analytics
- Security Event Monitoring (Syslog / Windows Event Logs)
- KQL (Kusto Query Language) for threat hunting

## Project Objectives
- Deploy an Azure Log Analytics workspace
- Connect the VM to the workspace for security event collection
- Deploy and configure Microsoft Sentinel
- Build analytic rules and alerts
- Create dashboards for threat visibility
- Test alerts with simulated attacks (e.g., failed login attempts)

## Key Features
- Real-time monitoring of VM login activities
- Custom alerts for suspicious behavior
- Dashboard visualization of critical security events
- Automated incident creation and notification setup

Advanced Multistage Attack Detection

Description: 
"Microsoft Sentinel uses Fusion, a correlation engine based on scalable machine learning algorithms, to automatically detect multistage attacks by identifying combinations of anomalous behaviors and suspicious activities that are observed at various stages of the kill chain. On the basis of these discoveries, Azure Sentinel generates incidents that would otherwise be very difficult to catch. By design, these incidents are low-volume, high-fidelity, and high-severity, which is why this detection is turned ON by default."
