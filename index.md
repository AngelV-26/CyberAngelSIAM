# üìö Featured Projects

#1. # Azure SIEM Monitoring Lab

# Project Overview
This project demonstrates how I deployed and configured Microsoft Sentinel (Azure SIEM) to monitor a Windows Virtual Machine (VM) for real-time security events hosted on Azure.

# Technologies Used
- Microsoft Sentinel (Azure SIEM)
- Azure Virtual Machine (Ubuntu/Windows)
- Azure Log Analytics
- Security Event Monitoring (Syslog / Windows Event Logs)
- KQL (Kusto Query Language) for threat hunting

# Project Objectives
- Deploy an Azure Log Analytics workspace
- Connect the VM to the workspace for security event collection
- Deploy and configure Microsoft Sentinel
- Build analytic rules and alerts
- Create dashboards for threat visibility
- Test alerts with simulated attacks (e.g., failed login attempts)

# Key Features
- Real-time monitoring of VM login activities
- Custom alerts for suspicious behavior
- Dashboard visualization of critical security events
- Automated incident creation and notification setup

# Screenshots

Advanced Multistage Attack Detection

Description: 
"Microsoft Sentinel uses Fusion, a correlation engine based on scalable machine learning algorithms, to automatically detect multistage attacks by identifying combinations of anomalous behaviors and suspicious activities that are observed at various stages of the kill chain. Based on these discoveries, Azure Sentinel generates incidents that would otherwise be very difficult to catch. By design, these incidents are low-volume, high-fidelity, and high-severity, so this detection is turned ON by default."

## 2.# üîê Python Password Rotation Script

Welcome to my cybersecurity automation project!

This Python script generates secure, random passwords for privileged accounts and simulates vault storage using timestamped files. It demonstrates key principles of PAM (Privileged Access Management) and is a great introduction to automation in identity security.

---

## üìÇ Features

- Random password generation using `secrets` and `string`
- Vault simulation folder with auto-generated `.txt` files
- Timestamped output for rotation tracking
- Simple to expand: encryption, logging, or API integration

---

## üí° Technologies Used

- Python 3
- `secrets` + `string` for password generation
- File handling with `os` and `datetime`

---

## üì∏ Screenshots

## You can try it yourself! 

''bash
git clone https://github.com/angelv-26/python-password-rotation-script.git
cd python-password-rotation-script
python rotate_passwords.py
